branding_details: "Live Long Genetics (LLG) approached us during their initial startup phase, and our first priority was to establish a strong branding foundation. They provided us with the essential labeling information required for their product. Leveraging this, we designed the bottle labels, created realistic mockups, and developed the packaging design for their supplement bottles. All designs were meticulously crafted to comply with EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) regulations, ensuring the product met the necessary standards for its launch in the UK market."

website_details: "Next, we designed and developed an intuitive, mobile-responsive e-commerce website tailored to drive conversions. The site was optimised for SEO to ensure that potential customers searching for anti-ageing supplements could easily find LLG+ online.
For marketing and advertising, we established LLG+'s presence on key social media platforms, creating engaging content to build a community around the brand. targeted ad campaigns were launched to raise brand awareness and drive traffic to the website, focusing on demographics aligned with LLG+'s customer profile."

overview: "Live Long Genetics (LLG+) approached Cloud9 with a vision—to transform a scientifically crafted anti-ageing supplement into a thriving e-commerce brand. This case study explores how Cloud9 led LLG+ from concept to launch, handling every facet of marketing, branding, design, and sales strategy."
challenge: "LLG+ faced the typical hurdles of a new brand entering the competitive health supplement market. They had no established online presence, lacked a distinct brand identity, and had no marketing or sales infrastructure in place. Additionally, they were working under a tight deadline to achieve product sales by 14th February. LLG+ needed more than just marketing—they required a comprehensive strategy that would position them as a credible, premium anti-ageing brand in the UK."
approach: "Our strategy was built around four key pillars. First, we focused on brand development, crafting a distinct identity that resonated with LLG+'s target audience—health-conscious individuals aged 35–65. This involved designing a logo, selecting brand colours and typography, and developing messaging that reflected vitality, longevity, and scientific credibility."
work: "Beyond generating leads, we implemented a comprehensive sales strategy. This included email marketing campaigns and retargeting ads designed to nurture prospects and ensure a strong conversion pipeline leading up to the February 14th goal."
process: "Collaborated with the client to create a compliant and visually appealing product design. Built a user-friendly Shopify store and executed targeted social media strategies to maximize reach and conversions."
results: "While the final sales figures will be available post-launch, Cloud9 has already achieved significant milestones. We have established a cohesive brand identity, launched a fully functional e-commerce website, built a growing social media following, and generated pre-launch buzz through targeted advertising. Based on current engagement metrics and ad conversion rates, we anticipate strong sales performance."
worker_statement: "Our comprehensive solutions helped Live Long Genetics create a strong brand identity, drive traffic, and boost sales in the competitive health and wellness market.This project showcases Cloud9's ability to turn an idea into a market-ready brand, deliver end-to-end solutions from branding to sales, and drive growth for e-commerce businesses in "
