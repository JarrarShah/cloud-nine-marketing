branding_details: "Live Long Genetics (LLG) approached us during their initial startup phase, and our first priority was to establish a strong branding foundation. They provided us with the essential labeling information required for their product. Leveraging this, we designed the bottle labels, created realistic mockups, and developed the packaging design for their supplement bottles. All designs were meticulously crafted to comply with EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) regulations, ensuring the product met the necessary standards for its launch in the UK market."
